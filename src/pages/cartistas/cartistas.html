                Behind their breakout hit "Ho Hey," Denver trio the Lumineers emerged in 2012 to 
                become one of the leading lights of the indie folk movement. Over the next several 
                years, they found widespread success based on their spirited live shows and organic 
                blend of rock, folk, and Americana styles. Their multiplatinum, Grammy-nominated debut 
                The Lumineers paved the way for the chart-topping 2016 follow-up Cleopatra.

                The roots of the band can be traced back to the East Coast where, in 2005, founding members 
                Wesley Schultz (vocals, guitar) and Jeremiah Fraites (drums, percussion) began working together 
                in a variety of different New York City bands. By 2009 they'd become more serious and chosen to 
                relocate to the unlikely musical hub of Denver, Colorado, where they met cellist and multi-instrumentalist 
                Neyla Pekarek. The success of their self-titled 2011 EP earned them a management deal, and they soon 
                decamped to Seattle to record their debut album with producer Ryan Hadlock.

                Prior to the album's release, the catchy "Ho Hey" single began picking up steam in influential 
                radio markets, and by the time Dualtone released the Lumineers' self-titled LP in April 2012, 
                they'd amassed considerable buzz. Buoyed by "Ho Hey" and the subsequent single "Stubborn Love" 
                (a song later revealed to be on President Obama's iPod playlist), the album eventually peaked 
                at number two on the Billboard Top 200 and earned them two Grammy nominations. A whirlwind of 
                touring occupied the next two years as the Lumineers' profile continued to rise. Schultz and 
                Fraites were pegged to ghostwrite "The Hanging Tree," a folk song used in the 2014 Jennifer 
                Lawrence film The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1. By 2016 they'd completed work on their 
                follow-up album, Cleopatra, which was released in April of that year, reaching number one in 
                the U.S., U.K., and Canada. Following their own world tour, the Lumineers were asked by U2 to 
                join the North American leg of their Joshua Tree anniversary tour.
