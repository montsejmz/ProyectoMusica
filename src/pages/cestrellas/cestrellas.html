              The Lumineers were never entirely the smiley, foot-stomping folkies 
              they seemed to be on “Ho Hey,” their inescapable Top 10 hit in 2012. 
              Four years later on their second album, “Cleopatra,” they put their serious intentions upfront.

              The mood is more existential, and the lyrics are often more oblique; 
              some songs are named after Shakespearean women, like “Ophelia” and 
              “Cleopatra.” Wesley Schultz’s guitar is almost always electric rather 
              than acoustic, with the amplification opening hollow places rather 
              than harnessing power; it’s joined in bare-bones arrangements by Jeremiah 
              Fraites, on piano and simplistic drums, and Neyla Pekarek, on cello

                Listening to The Lumineers’ self-titled 2012 debut is like having 
                a beer and a shot in a lively local bar at about 10:30 p.m. and 
                swapping stories with some sloshed strangers. There’s bragging, 
                joking, complaining, confessing, back-slapping, hand-clapping, and 
                rowdy shouting. A few dull stretches, sure, but mostly The Lumineers 
                is unassuming fun. There is one exception, however, a song that sticks 
                out like a gaudy tourist: “Ho Hey”, their world-conquering single, 
                which is certainly fun but hardly unassuming. The relationship is 
                simpler than in the other songs, the joy grander, and the scale epic 
                instead of bracingly intimate. It was used in an episode of the CW 
                show Hart of Dixie and went on to become a juggernaut.

                Now based in Denver, and a trio since the addition of cellist Neyla Pekarek, 
                the Lumineers left the bar circuit behind in 2012, when the single Ho Hey became 
                a worldwide hit (more determinism: a song called Ho Hey could only be a stomping 
                hayride of a song, and as such might be expected to turn up at the end of the set 
                rather than as the fourth song, where it’s dispatched so quickly the crowd barely 
                have a chance to pull out their phones). Their debut album received two Grammy 
                nominations, and the follow-up, Cleopatra, topped the US and UK album charts this month.
