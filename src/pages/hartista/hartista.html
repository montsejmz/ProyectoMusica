              which became an instant 
              hit and immediately brought him fame on the international 
              blues music scene. 
              His style of music is not only limited to blues but is 
              also heavily influenced by the rock and R&B genres. The 
              title song from his first extended play ‘Take Me to Church’ 
              made a remarkable debut on all leading charts in the country 
              by either occupying the first or the second positions. His second 
              extended play and its title song also did well on the top charts, 
              making in to the top 100 in the UK and reaching as high as the second 
              place in Ireland. He is a two-time Billboard Music Award winner who has 
              delivered numerous singles that have been accredited either gold or platinum.
