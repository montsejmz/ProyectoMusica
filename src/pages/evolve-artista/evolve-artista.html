                Rising from the Nevada desert in the late 2000s, rock outfit Imagine Dragons quickly became one of the most popular American bands 
                of the 2010s with their blend of arena rock energy and catchy pop choruses that dominated radio airplay.

              Winning their first Grammy Award in 2014 for the diamond-certified global smash "Radioactive" from their debut album, Night Visions, 
            Imagine Dragons remained near the top of the charts for much of the 2010s, topping the Billboard 200 with 2015's Smoke + Mirrors. 
            As their percussion-heavy sound shifted more toward radio-friendly, stadium-ready anthems, they secured worldwide favor with 2017's 
            Grammy-nominated Evolve, which delivered the trio of multi-platinum singles, "Believer," "Thunder," and "Whatever It Takes."

              The Las Vegas-based group had its genesis in Provo, Utah, where vocalist Dan Reynolds met drummer 
              Andrew Tolman while the two attended Brigham Young University. In 2009, the group, which by this 
              time included guitarist Daniel Wayne Sermon, bass player Ben McKee, and Tolman's wife Brittany Tolman 
              on keys and backing vocals, had made a name for itself regionally and relocated to Reynolds' hometown 
              of Las Vegas to record a pair of well-received EPs (Imagine Dragons and Hell and Silence) at the 
              Killers' Battle Born Studios. A third EP, It's Time, arrived the following year and helped land the 
              group a record deal with Interscope. The Tolmans parted ways with the group prior to the Interscope
               deal, and Daniel Platzman took over on drums.
