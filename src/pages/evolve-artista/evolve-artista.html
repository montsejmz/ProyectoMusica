                Rising from the Nevada desert in the late 2000s, rock outfit Imagine Dragons quickly became one of the most popular American bands 
                of the 2010s with their blend of arena rock energy and catchy pop choruses that dominated radio airplay. 
                Winning their first Grammy Award in 2014 for the diamond-certified global smash "Radioactive" from their debut album, Night Visions, 
                Imagine Dragons remained near the top of the charts for much of the 2010s, topping the Billboard 200 with 2015's Smoke + Mirrors. 
                As their percussion-heavy sound shifted more toward radio-friendly, stadium-ready anthems, they secured worldwide favor with 2017's 
                Grammy-nominated Evolve, which delivered the trio of multi-platinum singles, "Believer," "Thunder," and "Whatever It Takes."

                The Las Vegas-based group had its genesis in Provo, Utah, where vocalist Dan Reynolds met drummer 
                Andrew Tolman while the two attended Brigham Young University. In 2009, the group, which by this 
                time included guitarist Daniel Wayne Sermon, bass player Ben McKee, and Tolman's wife Brittany Tolman 
                on keys and backing vocals, had made a name for itself regionally and relocated to Reynolds' hometown 
                of Las Vegas to record a pair of well-received EPs (Imagine Dragons and Hell and Silence) at the 
                Killers' Battle Born Studios. A third EP, It's Time, arrived the following year and helped land the 
                group a record deal with Interscope. The Tolmans parted ways with the group prior to the Interscope
                 deal, and Daniel Platzman took over on drums.

                n 2012, Imagine Dragons hit it big with the Continued Silence EP and their debut long-player, 
                Night Visions, the latter of which debuted at the number two spot on the Billboard 200 and landed 
                the group multiple awards -- it later went double platinum in the U.S., largely on the smash 
                success of the Grammy-winning hit "Radioactive," which became the biggest-ever digital rock 
                track in America. During 2013, two other hits followed: "Demons" in the U.S. and "On Top of 
                the World" elsewhere. The group spent the bulk of 2014 finishing its second album. Co-produced 
                by Alex da Kid, Smoke + Mirrors arrived in February 2015 and debuted at number one, buoyed by 
                the singles "I Bet My Life" and "Shots." The band toured often between June of 2015 and February 
                of 2016, eventually releasing the concert set Smoke + Mirrors Live, recorded in 2015 at a sold-out 
                Air Canada Centre in Toronto.
