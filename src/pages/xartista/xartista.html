      who asked Sheeran to appear on his Sirius radio show. Soon after, in January 
      2011, Sheeran released yet another EP, his last as an independent artist. 
      Without any promotion, the record reached No. 2 on the iTunes chart, and he 
      signed on with Atlantic Records that same month.
